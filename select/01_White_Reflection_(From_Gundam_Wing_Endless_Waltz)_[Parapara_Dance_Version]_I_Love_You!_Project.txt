Lyrics to White Reflection- EnglishI feel your love reflection
A far away, never ending story is painted in your eyes as you gaze back at me

The wings (courage) you gave me, I spread open in my heart;
Their fluttering seems to shake off the sadness (despair) and pain (scars).

Aa, I want to feel the pain of the pulsing (shining) of irreplacable love

I feel your love reflection.
Pile up the dreams (ideals) thickly
Young ones who desire each other, fearless of mistakes.
I feel your love reflection
A far away, never ending story is painted in your eyes as you gaze back at me.

I want to softly communicate to your bare skin
The feelings that are spilling over
As if hugging close the strength (purity) to become gentle
