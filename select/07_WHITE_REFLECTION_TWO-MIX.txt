I feel your love reflection
見つめ返す 瞳に
描いて 遥かな neverending story
悲しみも 痛みも
振り切るように 羽ばたく
あなたがくれた 翼を
この胸に広げて
Aa かけがえない 愛の鼓動を
切なく くるおしく 感じていたい

I feel your love reflection
厚く夢を重ねて
過ち 恐れずに
求めあう 青春
I feel your love reflection
見つめ返す 瞳に
描いて 遥かな neverending story
溢れ出す思いを
素肌で そっと伝える
優しくなれる強さを
抱きしめるみたいに
Aa 激しく 揺れ動く 時代を
げだかく しなやかに 越えて行きたい
I feel your love reflection
許しあえる真実
口癖 交わした
もう何も言えない
I feel your love reflection
諦めない情熱
信じて貫く neverending story
I feel your love reflection
Atsuku yume wo kasanete
Ayamachi osorezu ni
Motomeau seishun
I feel your love reflection
Mitsumekaesu hitomi ni
Egaite haruka na neverending story
English translation
I feel your love reflection
In your eyes as they gaze back into mine
Writing a distant, neverending story
As if throwing off the sadness and pain,
I flap my wings,
And in my heart, i spread wide
The wings of courage that you've given to me
Ah... i want to feel the beat of this irreplacable love
So much, it's heart-wrenching and maddening
I feel your love reflection
Passionately uniting our dreams into one,
In our youth, we seek each other out,
Without being afraid of our own faults
I feel your love reflection
In your eyes as they gaze back into mine
Writing a distant, neverending story
We quietly express our overflowing emotions
With our bare skin,
As if to embrace
The strength to be gentle
Ah... aa, i want to hold my head up high,
And lithely go beyond this violent era
I feel your love reflection
The truth that we share
As long as we exchange kisses,
We don't need anything else anymore
I feel your love reflection
We'll stand firm and fight,
Believing in the passion we'll
never give up. it's our neverending story
I feel your love reflection
Passionately uniting our dreams into one,
In our youth, we seek each other out,
Without being afraid of our own faults
I feel your love reflection
In your eyes as they gaze back into mine
Writing a distant, neverending story
